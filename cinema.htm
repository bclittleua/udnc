<b><u>ZARDOZ</b></u> (1974) by <i>John Boorman</i><BR>
<small><b>Back of the box rundown:</b><BR>
In the year 2293, two castes populate the planet.<br>
The Eternals live in a sheltered community called the Vortex, where they live forever and are growing increasingly bored with it.<br>
The Brutals roam over the rest of the Earth. Wearing thigh high boots and bandoliers,
they battle and kill each other pointlessly<BR> with outdated weapons with no regard whatsoever as to were any of it came from.<br><BR>
Suddenly, a Brutal named Zed (none other than Sean Connery!),<br> finds his way into the Vortex by way of a giant/flying/talking stone head named (bum bum buuuum) <b>ZARDOZ</b> !!!<br>
Mayhem ensues, and from here on out, it <i>really</i> gets weird...<BR><BR>
<b>All in All:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think you've worked out all your issues, this movie will give you a good, swift kick in the ass.<br><b>4</b> out of <b>5</b> Mushrooms.<BR>
<small>More with John Boorman (who is otherwise a lost cause): The General (1998)</small>

<b><u>Dead Man</b></u> (1995) by <i>Jim Jarmusch</i><BR>
<small><b>Back of the box rundown:</b><br>
This movie is entirely up to interpretation. On the surface it's about William Blake(johnny depp), an unemployed nerd from pittsburgh, going to the west coast with his inheritance to pretty much have all the worst things in the world happen to him. <BR><BR>This movie is real art. Pay attention to it.<BR><small>More with Jim Jarmusch: Ghost Dog (the way of the samurai) [based on "<u><i>the hagakure</i></u>" featured in our literature section]
